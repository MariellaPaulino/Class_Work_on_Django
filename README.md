The purpose of this application is to create a new Flask app that allows users to post about a social justice topic. The app must:
- Make use of Bootstrap
- Make use of jQuery at least once
- Connect to a postgres database
- Have at least one view

For now, we will not incorporate email or user accounts/logins and will make note of those concepts that we do not yet understand or are unable to do.
